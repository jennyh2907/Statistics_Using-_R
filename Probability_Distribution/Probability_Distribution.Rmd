### Question1

#### Question1(a)

```{r }
# Create a vector for wheel and probability
wheel <- c(0:1000)
p <-rep(c(1/1000), times=1000)

# Find the theoretical mean and std 
theo_mean <- mean(wheel)
theo_var <- sum((wheel - theo_mean)^2)/1000
theo_sd <- sqrt(theo_var)

# Print out the result
sprintf("The theoretical mean of the winnings is %.3f. The theoretical std is %.3f.", theo_mean, theo_sd)
```

#### Question1(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (j)

```{r }
# Building the Sampling Distribution
set.seed(50)

# Use loop to simulate spins from 1 to 10
tab <- matrix(nrow = 5, ncol=10, byrow=TRUE)
i<-1
for(i in 1:10) {
 nam <- paste0("rep_spin_", i, sep = "")
 nam <- replicate(1000, {
    samp <- sample(wheel, i, replace = TRUE)})
 matrix_spin <- matrix(nam, nrow = i)
 matrix_spin <- t(matrix_spin)
 samp_means <- rowMeans(matrix_spin)
 matrix_spin <- cbind(matrix_spin, samp_means)
 prob_600 <- sum(samp_means > 600)/1000*100
 sm_average <- mean(samp_means)
 sm_sd <- sd(samp_means)
 print(paste0("The mean of sample mean for ", i, " spin is ", sm_average))
 print(paste0("The std of sample mean for ", i, " spin is ", sm_sd))
 print(paste0("The theoretical standard error for ", i, " spin is ", theo_sd/sqrt(1000*i)))
 print(paste0("The probability of winning more than $600 for ", i, " spin is ", prob_600, "%"))
 print(paste0("Replication containing ", i, " spin"))
 print(matrix_spin)
 hist(samp_means, main = paste0("Histogram of ", i, " spin"))
 tab[1, i] = theo_mean
 tab[2, i] = sm_average
 tab[3, i] = theo_sd/sqrt(1000*i)
 tab[4, i] = sm_sd
 tab[5, i] = prob_600
}
```

#### Question1(h)

The mean of sample means are all close to theoretical mean.

#### Question1(i)

The difference between theoretical standard error and std of sample mean is getting closer and closer as the number of spins in simulation increases.

#### Question1(j)


```{r }
#define column names and row names of matrix
colnames(tab) <- c('1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10')
rownames(tab) <- c('Theoretical Mean', 'Mean of Sample Means', 'Theoretical Standard Error', 'Standard Deviation of Sample Means', 'P(winning > $600)')

tab
```

### Question2

#### Question2(a)

Because different product family might account for different proportion for sale, therefore result in different mean of revenue, so it makes sense to use a stratified sample, stratified by product family, to estimate this mean

```{r }
# Read in the file
SupermarketTrans <- read_csv("SupermarketTrans.csv", col_types = cols(Revenue = col_number()))
set.seed(50)
```

#### Question2(b)

```{r }
# Find the proportion for each category in product family
Drink <- SupermarketTrans%>%
  filter(`Product Family`== "Drink")
Food <- SupermarketTrans%>%
  filter(`Product Family`== "Food")
Non_Consumable <- SupermarketTrans%>%
  filter(`Product Family`== "Non-Consumable")
Drink_prop <- nrow(Drink)/nrow(SupermarketTrans)
Food_prop <- nrow(Food)/nrow(SupermarketTrans)
Non_Consumable_prop <- nrow(Non_Consumable)/nrow(SupermarketTrans)

# Print out the result
sprintf("If the total sample size be 250, we should sample %.f from drink, %.f from food, %.f from Non-consumable", 250*Drink_prop, 250*Food_prop, 250*Non_Consumable_prop)
```

#### Question2(c)

```{r }
# Sampling
Drink_sample <- sample_n(Drink, 22)
Food_sample <- sample_n(Food, 181)
Non_Consumable_sample <- sample_n(Non_Consumable, 47)
Sample_mean_drink <- mean(Drink_sample$Revenue)
Sample_mean_food <- mean(Food_sample$Revenue)
Sample_mean_non_consumable <- mean(Non_Consumable_sample$Revenue)
sd_drink <- sd(Drink_sample$Revenue)
sd_food <- sd(Food_sample$Revenue)
sd_non_consumable <- sd(Non_Consumable_sample$Revenue)

# Print out the result
sprintf("The individual sample means from drink is %.f, from food is %.f, from non-consumable is %.f", Sample_mean_drink, Sample_mean_food, Sample_mean_non_consumable)
sprintf("The sample standard deviations from drink is %.f, from food is %.f, from non-consumable is %.f", sd_drink, sd_food, sd_non_consumable)
```

### Question3

#### Question3(a)

According to the confidence interval, we might be 95 percent confident that the interval between 17.087 and 19.129 contains the true population mean. So the billing system was effective.

```{r }

PaymentTimes <- read_csv("PaymentTimes.csv")

#Sample mean, sample size, population std
x_bar <- mean(PaymentTimes$PayTime)
n <- 65
sigma <- 4.2

#Z score for 95% confidence
z95 <- qnorm(0.975, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)

#95% CI
l95 <- x_bar - (z95*sigma/sqrt(n))
r95 <- x_bar + (z95*sigma/sqrt(n))

l95_rounded <- round(l95, digits = 3)

```

#### Question3(b)

According to the confidence interval, we might be 99 percent confident that the interval between 16.766 and 19.45 contains the true population mean. So the billing system was effective.

z99 <- qnorm(0.995, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)

# 99% CI
l99 <- x_bar - (z99*sigma/sqrt(n))
r99 <- x_bar + (z99*sigma/sqrt(n))

l99_rounded <- round(l99, digits = 3)
