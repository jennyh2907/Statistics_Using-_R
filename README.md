## **About the Repo - Statistics_Using_R**

### **1. EDA** 

_Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)_  is an essential step to understanding of an unknown datasets. This project involves performing EDA on dataset from UCI Machine Learning and some sample data from Professor Mehul Rangwala's class.

### **2. Probability_Distribution** 

A _probability distribution_ assigns a probability to each outcome in the sample space defined by a random process. This project shows the application of some classic probability distribution (e.g. Binomial, Poisson, Exponential) on different business scenarios.

### **3. Confidence_Interval + Hypothesis Test** 

A _confidence interval_ measures the uncertainty associated with estimates of population parameters, while a hypothesis test assesses the plausibility of a hypothesis based on sample data. This project includes several implementations of both techniques on sample datasets, which can help us gain insights into the underlying structure of the data.

### **4. ANOVA**

_Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)_ is a statistical method that compares the means of two or more groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. This project covers common designs of ANOVA, such as Completely Randomized Design (CRD), Randomized Block Design (RBD), and Factorial Design, and how they are applied to business cases.

### **5. Chi_Square**

_Chi Square_ is the key technique
when it comes to the association between two categorical variables. This project demonstrates some use cases of Chi-Squared contingency table and Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) test on sample data.

### **6. Simple_Linear_Regression**

_Simple Linear Regression_ identifies and models the linear relationship between two variables, and it's the fundamental of any advanced regression approaches. This project incorporates some coursework on simple linear regression under different circumstances.

### **7. Multiple_Linear_Regression**

_Multiple Linear Regression_ is a statistical method that extends Simple Linear Regression to model the linear relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. This project incorporates some coursework on multiple linear regression under different circumstances.

### **8. Weighted_Linear_Regression**

Based on the importance of each datapoints, _Weighted Linear Regression (WLS)_ assigns corresponding weights to them. Such design can improve the accuracy of a regression model.  This project demonstrates the process of computing weights for WLS model in R.

### **9. Statistical_Test**

Business problems are often complex and unpredictable, which can make it challenging for one to choose the appropriate _Statistical Test_ to use. This project provides a systematic analysis of various business problems and shows how each problem can lead to the selection of a specific statistical test.
